title: Using it
---

Once the Educates CLI extension pack is configured in your workshop manifest,
it will be injected and staged into your workshop session during its start up,
placed in the PATH, and with auto-completion enabled.

To verify the CLI functions correctly,

```execute
educates version
```

For bonus points,
try out autocomplete by typing the partial `educates` command and `version` subcommand.
