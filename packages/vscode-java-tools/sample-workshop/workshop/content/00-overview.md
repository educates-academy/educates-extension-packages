title: Overview
---

This workshop is a sample for configuring and using the
[Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

The workshop is not a substitute for the documentation,
but primarily serves as a way to verify the Educates Extension Package
in your Educates cluster.

{{< warning >}}
Beware the overloading of the term "Extension":

-   Educates uses the term *Extension Package* to identify an add-on feature that you
    can inject into a workshop session.

-   Visual Studio *Extension*,
    and in particular for *Extension Pack for Java*, identified the Visual Studio
    Extension that add features within VS Code editor for Java development.

They are completely different things!
